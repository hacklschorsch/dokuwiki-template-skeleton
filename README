Beware - work in progress!

This is my attempt to integrate the Skeleton Responsive Boilerplate (getskeleton.com) into the Dokuwiki Starter Template (https://github.com/selfthinker/dokuwiki_template_starter) to create a good base for quickly building responsive websites with some content management capabilities built in. 

ATM it has both -- The complete ``starter template'' CSS and the complete ``Skeleton'' CSS.
A bunch of the ``starter template'' code probably has to be factored out.

Of course I welcome all kinds of contributions, be it issues, pull req's, or whatev!
